## Why are Japanese people wearing a mask?
Nowadays, it seems to me that the regulation regarding COVID-19 is getting less strict for economy. Wearing a mask is a representative example of COVID-19.
The Japanese goverment announce that citizens do not have to wear a mask outdoors unless they keep a close distance. However, it appears that many people in public wear a mask outdoors even though the Japanese goverment does not require them to do it. Personally, I do not wear a mask outdoors because of the uncomfortableness. Then, why are Japanese people still wearing a mask under this circumstance. I beleive that there are several reasons to support my idea.

Firstly, the sense of beauty for Japanese people let them, especially women, wear a mask. Japan, which is an isolated island, has created unique cultures such as Anime. The indiginous people have not communicate as much as other folks including Europeans. Therefore, extrovert components like immigrants did not affect our views until the modern era. On the contrary, the uniqueness narrows our perspective. The perspective gives a negative impact on the sense of beauty for Japanese people. As you can easily notice that all Japanese models in fashon magazines looks similar. The reason why their appearances are homogenious is that we have unwritten sense of beauty, and there are some people who are suffering from it.
